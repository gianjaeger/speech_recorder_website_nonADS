        <h1>Speech Characteristics</h1>
        <p>Welcome to our research study investigating speech characteristics in adults. Your participation is greatly appreciated and contributes to valuable research in this field. Please read through the information carefully and complete all sections.</p>

        <div id="consent-section" class="study-section">
            <h2>1. Informed Consent</h2>
            <p>Please read the following information carefully. By proceeding, you confirm your understanding and agreement to participate.</p>

            <h3>Study Title: Speech Characteristics in Adults (Non-Autism Part)</h3>

            <h3>Purpose of the Research:</h3>
            <p>This study aims to investigate differences and similarities in speech characteristics among adults. By analyzing various aspects of spoken language, we hope to gain a better understanding of speech patterns and to develop potential objective measures for research purposes. Your data will contribute to the **non-autism part** of this research.</p>

            <h3>What You Will Be Asked to Do:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Complete a short demographic and background survey.</li>
                <li>Perform three short speech tasks:</li> <ul>
                    <li>Reading a brief passage aloud.</li>
                    <li>Describing a picture for approximately one minute.</li>
                    <li>Speaking freely about something memorable you did recently.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Your speech will be audio-recorded during these tasks. You will have the opportunity to listen back to your recordings and retake them before submitting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Time Commitment:</h3>
            <p>The entire study is expected to take approximately 10 minutes.</p>

            <h3>Confidentiality and Data Management:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>All data collected, including audio recordings and survey responses, will be treated with strict confidentiality.</li>
                <li>Your data will be pseudo-anonymised, meaning it will be assigned a unique code and stored separately from any personal identifying information (e.g., your Prolific ID).</li>
                <li>Raw audio files will be stored securely on encrypted servers accessible only by the research team for a period of up to 1 year, as per institutional data retention policies, in full compliance with UK data protection laws. Your recordings will only be accessed and listened to by the researcher and will not be shared, redistributed, or sold to any third parties.</li>
                <li>Your aggregated, de-identified data may be used in future research studies, published in scientific journals, or presented at academic conferences. Individual data will never be identifiable in any public dissemination.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Voluntary Participation and Right to Withdraw:</h3>
            <p>Participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You are free to decline to participate, or to withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, without penalty. If you withdraw, any data collected from you (if not yet processed for analysis) will be destroyed.</p>
            <p>You may request the deletion of your data within 10 days of submission by contacting the researcher via Prolific or by email at gian.jaeger@wolfson.ox.ac.uk. Data will be securely destroyed upon request.</p>

                <p>When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. People look, but no one ever finds it. When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.</p>
